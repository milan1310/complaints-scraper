# Complaint scraper using Python

In this project i have used playwright and used webkit browser to scrap the data from the website.

As well I have used beautifulsoup for reading and parsing content of the website.

So befor running this script you have to install following packages into your system
1. `playwright`
2. `BeautifulSoup`

To install this please run this command `pip install beautifulsoup playwrite`
